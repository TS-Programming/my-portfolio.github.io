My adventures in gaming began at the tender age of 8, piecing together simple games alongside my siblings. Fast forward to 16, and I proudly introduced my first mobile game to both the App Store and Google Play.

                Here, you'll find a mix of my professional work and personal projects - those I crafted on caffeine-fueled nights, fueled by genuine enthusiasm. My curious nature always pushes me to dive deep into game mechanics, ensuring every aspect shines. Sometimes, this curiosity leads me down paths I must remain discreet about... let's keep that between us.

                When I'm not engrossed in games, I occasionally venture into web design, like this site you're on. Got questions or thoughts? Don't hesitate to drop me a line! */}

                Ever since I was 3 years old, video games have offered some of my most formative experiences. 
                Growing up, whether it was learning to count and problem-solve in classic platformers or,
                developing cooperation and sportsmanship in multiplayer games, every stage was a unique quest - unlocking 
                the next level in both my virtual adventures and personal journey. Around the time I graduated high school 
                games took me on a path that would teach me how to surpass my limits. That's when I started competing in esports, 
                namely Super Smash Bros Melee. Over the years I've climbed to the highest rank in my region while making lifelong 
                relationships and becoming a community leader. As I continued to grind Melee I gained a deep understanding of its
                mechanics and that changed the way I looked at video games. In  an effort to improve, analyzing frame data, collision 
                boxes, movement mechanics, and bugs also peaked my interest in game development. So, shortly after earning a certificate
                in digital audio from Santa Rosa Junior College in 2019, I decided to go back to school to get a bachelors in 
                computer science and become a game developer. I made games throughout the rest of my time at SRJC and after
                I transferred to Sonoma State University to complete my degree. While attending college and learning game development on my 
                own, I also worked as an audio engineer and event technician, handling sound and lighting for performances. 
                In 2021 after 2 years of studying computer science I landed an 8 month internship at VIAVI solutions where
                I worked in robotics programming. This not only further expanding my technical skillset,
                but also gave me a first-hand understanding of real-world applications. Since graduating from SSU in 2023,
                I've taken the opportunity to develop applications every day. I hope you enjoy what I've been up to.
